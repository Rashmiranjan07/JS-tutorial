 History of JavaScript
---------------------

- Invented by `“Brandan Eich”` at `Netscape` in `1995` originally named as `"LiveScript"`
- `Netscape` & `Sun Java` agreements to rename `"LiveScript"` to `"JavaScript"` (As `java` is already popular in the market)
- Not at-all related to `JAVA` (completely different in concept and design)
- `Microsoft` has developed new version of "JavaScript" as `"JScript"` for `IE-3` in `1996`
- JavaScript Submitted to `ECMAScript in 1997`


JavaScript Getting Started
=====================
How to write Javascript?
---------------------
JavaScript in HTML
---------------------

- The HTML `<script>.....</script>` tag is used to embed/insert/implement a JavaScript programs/code into any part of an HTML document/page
- The `<script>.....</script>` tag specifies that we are using JavaScript
- The `<script>.....</script>` element can be placed in the `<head>`, or `<body>` section of an HTML document
- Each `<script>.....</script>` tag blocks the page rendering process until it has fully downloaded and executed the JavaScript code
  - So the best practice is to place/add the `<script>.....</script>` at the bottom/end of `body` tag/section ie. just before the closing `</body>` tag
